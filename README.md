# Stan Case Study

This repository contains the case study: *Interacting with external c++ and implementing distributions with analytic derivatives in Stan*.

The case study was originally written in LaTeX for enhanced typography and can be converted to other formats via `pandoc` to facilitate wider distribution.

The [PDF version](/docs/maindoc.pdf) can be downloaded from GitHub.

The [LaTeX source code](/docs/maindoc.tex) can be converted to markdown by running the following command:

```shell
pandoc "maindoc.tex" -o "maindoc.md" --wrap=none
```

The [Markdown version](/docs/maindoc.md) can be previewed directly on GitHub.
